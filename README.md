# Mailchimp Challenge

## Getting Started

To take things for test drive you can do so by running
```
ruby md_to_html.rb sample.md
```

If you'd like to use your own markdown you can reference your own file as the first arg or replace the text in sample.md.

## Running Tests

To run tests you'll have to do

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Then finally

```
bundle exec rspec
```
